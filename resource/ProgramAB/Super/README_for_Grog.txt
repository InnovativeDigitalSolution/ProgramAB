@Grog:

InMoov set of AIML is based on this set.
It contains more functions than Alice.
I have removed many things that were causing issues or errors for InMoov, 
but maybe it is good to have this set available for developpers.

The AIMLIF was still part of this set because it was prior Manticore.

Of course overtime, InMoov set also has now functions that this set doesn't have which are pretty nice.

Note, there is tools for programAB available in myrobotlab/tools/AimlTools, 
maybe the integration of some tool could be very usefull. I don't know if it is possible though...
Those tools were working nicely when we had AIMLIF available, 
but it means doing a conversion everytime with the converter tools.

One thing that has always been a problem with AIML sets is the definition of sex for the bot.
I wonder if we could define that somewhere on lower level to be used within the set.
Of course it will mean some refactor, which we might put for another release.
